items:
- research_minor not implemented
- breach not implemented

gui design:
- need a way to reliably show reports (remember to use x/y/w/h +9/-9 to find
  wordwrap size)

function:
- determine a 'find rate' to use to determine when reports are added to queue
- actions to take when reading a report
  (for example, don't automatically assign us that it was captured, that needs
   to be based on actions taken)
  (note: multiple is not handled properly yet, I need to have non-multiples
   removed when they are successfully acted upon)
