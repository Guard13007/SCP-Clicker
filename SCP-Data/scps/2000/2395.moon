  description: [[SCP-2395 is a giant price tag, located at 82°08'02.1"S 16°59'05.5"W in Antarctica. Observing aerial drones have recorded SCP-2395 to have the price of "$҉ 585.98" [sic].
  .
  SCP-2395 is tied to a small rebar loop embedded in the ground by a 0.7m length of twine. SCP-2395's dimensions are 258m by 90m in length and width; a 2.5 m layer of Polyethylene covers the paper inscribed with SCP-2395's price.
  .
  SCP-2395 possesses unpredictable centrifugal and centripetal movement around the rebar loop, usually being manipulated and shifted by unknown forces in random directions and velocities. One instance has occurred where SCP-2395 maintained a constant velocity of approximately 65km/h on the date of 11/2/16, spinning clockwise for 49 seconds. Researchers note the twine that secures SCP-2395 to the rebar loop may possess anomalous tensile properties.
  .
  SCP-2395-A is a wooden shack located 0.3km east of SCP-2395. The structure is empty, save for a room in which an unknown individual, presumably a human female, prohibits access from within. The door to their room is engraved with the initials "L.C.E." This individual (designated SCP-2395-B) has responded to no verbal communication, but has occasionally been recorded conversing with other entities.]]
