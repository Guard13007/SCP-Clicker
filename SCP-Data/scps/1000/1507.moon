Instances of SCP-1507 have the same behavior patterns as a normal specimen of Phoeniconais ruber ruber, but do not require feeding. Instances of SCP-1507 are vulnerable to the same forces as ordinary plastic would be vulnerable to, such as heat and pressure. Testing has shown they do not possess any complex intelligence.

  Instances of SCP-1507 are tolerant of human activity, and are fond of playing with staff.]]

  Instances of SCP-1507 are universally hostile towards humans, and have been known to attack personnel who enter the enclosure by dropping down on them, using their metal stands to create scratch wounds and puncture wounds in their victim's face and eyes. SCP-1507 will frequently appear docile until it attacks, leading to several cases of severe injury among research staff.]]
