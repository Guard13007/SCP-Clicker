  description: [[Organic Testing of SCP-622 to determine shelf life of chemical compound [REDACTED - O5 PERSONNEL ONLY] in an outdoor environment.
  .
  Procedure: SCP-622 will be applied to a small patch of grass on the Site 16 Testing Biosphere 07 and viewed through remote monitoring devices. Moisture measured and monitored by electronic instruments. For a control, Testing Biosphere 02 and 01 were also monitored for humidity content, averaging at 68% and 73% relative humidity, respectively.
  .
  Results: Within the first minute of exposure, the humidity of Biosphere 07 dropped to 0%, forming a brown crust along where 622 was sprayed. Within two (2) minutes of testing, all flora within Biosphere 07 had shriveled up, turning into a salt-like compound similar to SCP-622. All of the mud within Biosphere 07 turned to dry, cracked dirt. After three (3) minutes, security notified testing staff that the surrounding plant life of Site 16 was beginning to turn brown outside of Biosphere 07, despite the airtight nature of the Biosphere. Site 16 staff dispatched to surround the area and stop SCP-622 from spreading. After five (5) minutes, SCP-622 has covered over 0.017 square kilometers, spreading at an estimated rate of 0.2 kilometers an hour or roughly 3 meters per minute. Site 16 proceed to dump water on the surrounding are to stop SCP-622 from spreading. SCP-622 quickly absorbs all water and continues spreading. Site 16 command level staff immediately request to enact Protocol Grey. O5 approves. Protocol Grey enacted.

  --- END LOG ---
  .
  While this does pose a possible threat leading to an eventual NK-Class "Grey Goo" end of the world scenario, Foundation staff are doing their best to contain the problem. Site 16 staff have enacted Protocol Grey to slow the rate of SCP-622 spreading and are currently looking into how SCP-622 was able to breach the Biosphere Testing Facility.
  .
  To help alleviate fears, here are a few facts that we would like you all to know.
  .
  - All of the biological SCPs at Site 16 have been secured and transferred away from the spread of SCP-622. Space will be slightly more cramped, but the situation is under control and all of the SCPs are in proper containment.
  - As of now, SCP-622 has only spread a total of less than three square kilometers, and the rate has slowed thanks to Protocol Grey. At the rate it's going, it will only be able to overtake Site 16 in 7 years. Even then, we still have plenty of time before it reaches any urban areas.
  - SCP-622 can be slowed down by water; especially fluoridated water. As long as we keep pumping over water to Site 16, it will buy us extra time until we can think of a solution.
  - We have a list of all of the known companies that are still in possession of SCP-622 and are actively seeking to contain every last canister before they can be used.
  .
  Lastly, I know some of you are shaky about Protocol Grey. It may come back to bite us, but I'd much rather worry about an XK-Class end of the world event in a few hundred years than an NK-Class "Grey Goo" end of the world event in the next few weeks. We'll deal with that then, but for now, Protocol Grey is buying us time. As long as we end Protocol Grey in the next ten years, I don't think there's anything we'll need to worry about.
  .
  I will notify everyone once SCP-622 has been contained and when Site 16 staff discover why it was able to breach containment.
  .
  Carry on,
