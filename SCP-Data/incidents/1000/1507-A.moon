  description: [[Yesterday, Researcher Boyd was playing with SCP-1507-8 during his break. During this time, SCP-1507-8 playfully attempted to take food from him. Taking this as an aggressive action, Boyd knocked SCP-1507-8 to the floor, cracking the plastic shell of the creature. After the incident, all instances of SCP-1507 have become highly aggressive towards staff members. Containment procedures have been slated for revision, and in the meantime all staff members must exercise caution when going into SCP-1507's enclosure.]]
