Using icons from game-icons.net, see game-icons-license-info.txt

- Also using the Lume library: https://github.com/rxi/lume
- And Kikito's cron.lua: https://github.com/kikito/cron.lua

Additionally using my own LovePackaging build system (which is kinda crappy, but
works) and Pop.Box GUI library (which is heavily alpha, but better now that I'm
using it).
